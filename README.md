I am currently pursuing a BCom in _Transportation and Logistics_, and I am really excited to be almost done.

#Why am I interested in this workshop?
I see this as the perfect opportunity to develop skills that will help me to be successful in the ~~future~~, right now. I believe the value of this workshop is captured in the following passage: 

> <font color='blue'>Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime</font>
