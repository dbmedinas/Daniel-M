#Who am I?

My name is **Daniel B Medinas**, I am an internatinal student from Brazil. However, I am not from Rio, I am from Sao Paulo the most important city in Latin America.

I am currently pursuing a BCom in _Transportation and Logistics_, and I am really excited to be almost done.

#Why am I interested in this workshop?
I see this as the perfect opportunity to develop skills that will help me to be successful in the ~~future~~, right now. I believe the value of this workshop is captured in the following passage: 

> <font color='blue'>Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime</font>

# <font color='purple'>Steps Involved in "Pushing" the README to my repository on Github</font>

In order to push my README.md to my Github repository I did the following.

1. I created a new repository at my Github (called it Daniel_BM)
2. I copied the SSH address
3. I opened Rstudio and created a new project
4. I pasted the repository SSH to linke the project to Github
5. I posted all the info in the README - It was impossible to create a colour code that would "migrate" to Github. The colour appears when I preview HTML in Rstudio, but it does not appear in Github
6. I selected Git in the top right corner of RStudio and pressed commit
7. In the new screen, I selected README.md, I worte a message in the top right corner, pressed commit and pressed push.
